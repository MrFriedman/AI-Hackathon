# Project description

Please provide a comprehensive description of your approach to the given problem statement. Add images, charts, links, anything that you think is necessary to describe your submission.
This is a centralized platform for accident reporting, designed to encourage drivers, passengers, and bystanders to upload digital evidence of road incidents. The primary form of evidence includes video footage from dashcams and smartphones.

Main features include:

- **Easy upload of video footage**\
  The user will be able to obtain an analysis of their video footage.
- **Autofill of insurance claim forms**\
  Most drivers will need to fill in a claim form and submit it to their insurance provider. This platform can help streamline this process by autofilling in claims form with the driver's information and accident details from the video footage.
- **Local accident GPS tracker**\
  Geospatial data from video footage analysis is used to make this.
- **Generate report summary for sharing**

# Project execution

Since one of the key features of this Hackathon is a **working Prototype**, please provide a step-by-step guide on how to run your submission.

# Future Roadmap

Future uses of our application:

- Low-cost dashcams can be sold with our system.
- Users can opt in to share their video footage to a network of other users to promote road safety awareness and prevalence of reckless driving.
- What makes your application scalable?
- What is missing in your current implementation that you would include in a production grade application?
